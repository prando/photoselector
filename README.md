# what
This is a naive Tkinter (Python) based Photo viewer application. 

# why
Our wedding photographer gave us 2,957 photographs after our wedding and we had the onerous task of choosing a couple hundred for album printing/ framing. I couldn't find any photoviewer/ online photo management systems to do this. 
This app enables selecting photos from a dir and listing them for further processing. 

# how
* Requires Python 2.7 or greater (TKinter is the standard Py interface to Tk GUI toolkit).
* Install <a href="http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/installation.html#windows-installation"> pillow </a> (Python Imaging Library) for your platform (Mac/Linux/Windows). 
* To Run, from terminal: `python photo.py`
