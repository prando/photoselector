This is a naive Tkinter (Python) based Photo viewer application. 

# Backstory
Wedding photographers are ruthless in the raw image shots that they capture. After the deluge, the bridegroom is presented with literally thousands of photos out of which a few hundred need to be selected for album-printing/framing. This is a humungous task and I couldn't find any photoviewer/ online photo management systems to do this. This app enables loading a directory of photos, navigating among them and enable choosing between them and finally list the chosen ones.
