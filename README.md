# photoselector

This is a naive Tkinter (Python) based Photo viewer application. 

# Backstory
Our wedding photographer gave us 2,957 photographs after our wedding and we had the onerous task of choosing a couple hundred for album printing/ framing. I couldn't find any photoviewer/ online photo management systems to do this. This app enables loading a directory of photos, view and enable choosing between them and finally list the chosen ones. 

# Requirements
1. Python 2.7 and greater. 
2. Install <a href="http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/installation.html#windows-installation"> PIL </a>
3. Run: python photo.py
